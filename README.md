#flask-voice-assistant
Simple voice assistant using Flask and Python

This is a simple voice assistant built using Python and Flask. It listens to your voice through the microphone, converts it to text, detects what you’re trying to say (intent), and gives a voice + text response.

This project was created as part of a 20-day AI Voice Assistant Internship.

What it can do

- Takes voice input from your mic
- Understands simple commands like “hello”, “what time is it”, or “bye”
- Detects the intent of your speech
- Speaks the response out loud
- Also shows the response in your browser in clean JSON format

How to set it up

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Make sure Python is installed on your system
3. Install the required Python packages:
    pip install Flask SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
    pip install pipwin
